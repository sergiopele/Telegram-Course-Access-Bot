ðŸ›  Maintenance Guide - Course Access Bot

1. Add New Verified Customers
	â€¢	Open the linked Google Sheet.
	â€¢	Insert new customer emails into Column A (starting from Row 1).
	â€¢	Leave Column B empty â€” the bot will automatically populate it after a user verifies.

2. Google Sheet Permissions
	â€¢	The linked Google Service Account must have Editor access to the Google Sheet.
	â€¢	Share the Sheet with your Service Account email address.

3. Controlling Access Behavior
	â€¢	ALLOW_MULTIPLE_USERS_PER_EMAIL=true: Allow multiple users per email (Telegram IDs will be comma-separated).
	â€¢	ALLOW_MULTIPLE_USERS_PER_EMAIL=false: Only the first verified Telegram ID will be allowed per email. Others will be rejected.

4. Limit Number of Verification Attempts (Anti-Abuse)
	â€¢	MAX_VERIFICATION_ATTEMPTS=3 (or any number):
Set the maximum number of email verification attempts per user session.
	â€¢	After exceeding this limit, users will receive a message prompting them to contact support.
	â€¢	This prevents overuse of the Google Sheets API and abuse.

5. Update Invite Link, Support Email, or Other Configs
	â€¢	Modify any of the following in Railway > Environment Variables (no code changes needed):
	â€¢	PRIVATE_GROUP_INVITE_LINK
	â€¢	SUPPORT_EMAIL
	â€¢	GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME
	â€¢	ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID

6. Rotate Google Credentials
	â€¢	In Google Cloud Console:
	â€¢	Create a new Service Account key.
	â€¢	Download the .json key file.
	â€¢	Encode it to Base64 using base64 google_credentials.json (Mac/Linux) or PowerShell.
	â€¢	Paste the string into Railway under the variable: GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_B64.

7. Monitoring Activity
	â€¢	Bot logs all interactions, including successful and failed verifications, into bot_actions.log.
	â€¢	You can access logs from:
	â€¢	Railway logs panel (live),
	â€¢	Local log file when testing locally.

8. Security Best Practices
	â€¢	Never commit sensitive files (like google_credentials.json) to GitHub.
	â€¢	Use .env or Railway ENV variables to store secrets.
	â€¢	Protect your Railway and Google accounts with 2FA.
	â€¢	Grant least privilege access to your Google Service Account.
